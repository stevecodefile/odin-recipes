    <h2>Air Fryer Chicken Tenders</h2>
    <h5>Simple, basic air fryer chicken tenders that are crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside, and packed full of flavor. Dip in ranch or your favorite dipping sauce.</h5>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon parsley flakes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds chicken tenderloins</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    
        <ol>
            <li><b>Step 1</b></li>
            <p>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions.</p>
            <li><b>Step 2</b></li>
            <p>Combine flour, paprika, parsley, seasoned salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Beat egg in a separate bowl.</p>
            <li><b>Step 3</b></li>
            <p>Dredge each chicken tender in seasoned flour. Dip in beaten egg, then back in seasoned flour.</p>
            <li><b>Step 4</b></li>
            <p>Coat basket with cooking spray; place as many coated chicken tenders in the air fryer basket as you can without overcrowding. Lightly mist the tops of the tenders with cooking spray.

            </p>
            <li><b>Step 5</b></li>
            <p>Cook in the preheated air fryer for 8 minutes. Flip chicken over and lightly mist the tops with more cooking spray. Continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chicken reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 8 minutes more. Repeat with any remaining chicken tenders.</p>

        </ol>
